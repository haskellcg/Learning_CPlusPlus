# C++ 11
  Is was approved by IOS on 12 August 2011, replacing **C++03**, superseded by **C++14** on 18 August 2014 and later, by **C++17**. It was formerly named **C++0x** because it was expected to be published before 2010.
  
  Areas of the core language that were significantly improved include **multithread support, generic programming support, uniform initialization, and performance**.
  
## Design goals 
  * Maintain stability and compatibility with **C++98** and possible with **C**
  * Prefer introducing new features via the standard library, rather than extending the core language
  * Prefer changes that can evolve programming technique
  * Improve C++ to facilitate systems and library design, rather than introducing new features usedful only to specific applications
  * Increase type safety by providing safer alternatives to earlier unsafe techniques
  * Increase performance and the ability to work directly with hardware
  * Provide proper solutions for real-world problems
  * Implement zero-overhead principle (further support needed by some utilities must be used only if the utility is used)
  * Make C++ easy to teach and to learn without removing any utility needed by expert programmers
