# C++ 20
  C++20 is the informal name for the revision of the ISO/IEC standard for the C++ programming language except to follow C++17. The C++ Standards Committee began panning C++20 in july of 2017, the curent draft is N4713.
  
## Possible new language features  
  * The following were voted into the C++20 draft in 2017:
    * Concepts
    * Designated initializers
    * [=, this] as a lambda capture
    * Template parameter lists on lambdas
  * Features voted into C++20 in the fall meeting in November 2017 include:
    * Three-way comparison using the "spaceship operator", operator<=>
    * Initialisation of an additional veriable within a range-based for statement
    * Bit-casting of object representations, with less verbosity than memcpy() and more ability to exploit compile internals
    * A specialisation of std::atomic for std::shared\_ptr
    * Lambdas in unevaluated context. This removes the long-standing restriction against having a lambda-expression inside a decltype in many contexts
    * Default constructible and assignable stateless lambdas
    * Allow pack expansions in lambda init-capture. There was no compelling to disallow this
  * Other possible new language features

## Possible library changes
  * Atomic smart pointers (std::atomic_shared_ptr and std::atomic_weak_ptr)
  * Extended futures
  * Latches and barries
  * Networking extensions, including async, basic I/O services, timers, buffers and buffer-oreinted streams, sockets, and Internet protocols
  * Ranges
  * Task blocks
